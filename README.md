Genfanad is a brand new game based on classic games of the past. http://genfanad.com/ If you're interested in playing or developing for it, please come join our discord at https://discord.gg/uN3Vvsv.

# Startup Guide
* Install Node (and npm). (https://nodejs.org/en/)
* Run the editor.
  * If you are on Windows, run (double-click) the 'start-windows.bat' file.
  * If you are on another OS, run 'node ./editor/main.js' in a terminal.
* Open the script editing tools in your browser. It defaults to http://localhost:7782.

# Feature Requests
* Feel free to send PRs or bugs to this Github repository.
* Please note, changes to this must be kept in sync with the game runtime code (which is not public), so any language change proposals without prior discussion will be rejected.

# Introduction
Genfanad scripts are little programs that are compiled into a graph. The program remains statically loaded in memory. Every instance of it running is just a pointer to a specific node. This allows multiple players to be talking to the same NPC at once while storing minimal state.

The compiled version of the code has a root node and a map of node name -> node info. Each node has a ‘type’ and a ‘next’ pointer, which is the next node to execute.

As you may guess, this language is very TWINE-inspired.

When a script runs, it will execute every node until it finds a stopping point – either the end of the script or a node that requires input. For example, a ‘message’ node will pause for the player to hit ‘continue’ before continuing execution. However, a ‘setvar’ node will set the variable and move onto the next node immediately.

# GScript Definition
The Genfanad Scripting language is a simple language that compiles each instruction into a node. It contains some syntactic sugar to make it easier to specify many conditions, and automatically names nodes.

It is not a complete language. If you can think of a useful language feature that would save coding time (as long as it compiles into the same nodes as before!), please let us know and we can probably build it pretty quickly. If you can think of simpler ways to implement commands we can do those as well.

# Things
Genfanad script is used, as you guessed, to script Genfanad. As such, it exposes a lot of game state using the scripts.

Anything named in gscript—labels, variables and files—must be **all lowercase** and generally only contain **alphanumeric characters and underscores**.

## Variables
Variables are per-player values – either integers or flags (true/false). Generally, they are namespaced to a specific quest. For example, cornpop/has_recipe is a quest flag for the ‘cornpop’ quest that is named ‘has_recipe’. 

Note: Every variable used takes up database space for *every* player - do not use more variables than is appropriate, and do not use variables for random ‘have I given you a random item’ flags. We may in the future choose to delete all variables after a quest is complete. 

## Skills
A player’s skill level is their current level in that skill, including all buffs. For example, if a player has 10 mining and has drunk a mining potion so is temporarily 15/10, they will pass all skill checks for level 15.

## Items
Players have a limited inventory, and items can be gained and lost using scripts.

Note: A player can lose an item at any time, so make sure if you give them something the game logic accounts for the possibility of them losing it.

# Commands
A command is a single line or, in the case of multiline commands, end with a line that says ‘end’. In both cases, they are a single word and all commands are documented later in this document.

    message Hello! // this is a single line command

And an example multiline command:

    switch domain/variable // this is a multi-line command
      true -> branch1
      false -> branch2
    end // everything from ‘switch’ to ‘end’ is part of this ‘switch’ command

## Command Types

GScript commands fall roughly into four types:

:zap: Some commands are ***immediate***. They do their thing and then move on to the next node.

:left_right_arrow: ***Immediate conditional*** commands are multiline commands that run a check before deciding where to go. What happens when each of its conditions are met must be stipulated. These end with a new line and the word `end`.

:grey_question: `userchoice` is a ***delayed conditional*** that waits for user input before deciding where to go. It also ends with a new line and the word `end`.

:stop_sign: ***Termination*** commands perform their action and then end the script.

# Comments
Comments use C-style double slashes. Use them to explain what your logic is doing. They can be on any line, by themselves or not. Everything after the ‘//’ is ignored, as are empty lines.

    message Hello! // This is a comment.
    // This is also a comment.

Empty lines are allowed for spacing sections out.

    // Empty lines are allowed.

# Labels
A line ending with : is a label. Other code can jump to labels, whether through ‘goto’ commands or through branches. Each label can only be used once in a specific script. Labels must be on their own line.

    foo: // ‘foo’ is a label

# Simple Commands
## Messages
    npcmessage Hello. // NPC says Hello.
    playermessage Hi. // Player says hello.
    narration A weird omniscient voice says Hello too. // Narration.
    
    otherspeaker Name: Hello. // Another person speaking. Should only be used
                              // if they are guaranteed to be nearby.
    
    simplemessage This happened. // Prints that message as a game action but
                                 // continues script.

    nothing-interesting-happens // Self explanatory.
    
    < Hello. // Alias for NPC says.
    > Hi. // Alias for player says
    = Narration! // Alias for narration

## Interfaces
### Interface Popups
    openstore // If attached to NPC with a store, opens it

    openbank // If attached to banker, opens bank
    
    interface <type> // Launches that interface type. 
                     // Only ‘appearance’ is supported today.

## Movement
### Passdoor
Passdoor is a **terminating** command to be used on doors, that moves the character through the door then ends the script. Typically, if there is danger on either side of the door, you do *not* want to add dialogue before a passdoor, as that would result in a player clicking a door then getting attacked while the text appears on screen.

    passdoor // only used on scripts attached to doors – the player walks through

### Teleport
Teleports the player to a specific coordinate. Generally, scripts do not continue after you teleport, so this is a terminating command.

    teleport <layer> <x> <y>
    teleport world 10 50

## Control Flow
### Noop
Does nothing. Sometimes useful, usually not.

    noop

### goto
Jumps to a specific label. Useful when you have a few different branches that go back to a central decision tree.

    goto <label>

### Random goto
Randomly jumps to one of the labels specified. In this case, a, b, or c. 

This should generally only be used for alternate chat messages. Do not make any complicated logic or quest decisions using this code.

    random_goto <a> <b> <c>

### User Choice
Allows the player to make a choice of options.

    userchoice Question to player?
      Yes -> <label>
      No, never! -> <label>
    end

## Variables
Variables are either flags (true/false) or integer values tied to a player account.

Variables have a storage cost associated with them. They should be used for quests but not for general purpose things like doors or generic NPC dialogue.

### Set Variable
Sets a player flag to a value.

    setvar <domain>/<name> true
    setvar popcorn/talked_to_gourmet true
    setvar popcorn/recipe_count 5

### Increment Variable
Increments a variable by one.

    incrementvar <var>
    incrementvar popcorn/talked_count

### Variable Switch
Will read a variable and go to a branch depending on its value. If no branch exists for the specific value of the variable, it will jump to the ‘default’ branch. Generally, this should only be used for flags (true/false), rather than numeric values.

    switch <variable>
      <value> -> <label>
      <value> -> <label>
      default -> <label>
    end

## Items
Item definitions are files that have an image, name, examine text (typically a joke), and various other properties associated with them. Within a command, items are referenced with a dash-separated string that specifies its location.

    hasitem quest-example_quest-aardvark 3 

Instances of an item can be dropped or stored in a bank; therefore any item can be lost or misplaced. Because quests often give and require specific items, all quest logic must have provisions for giving the item out again to ensure players will not be locked out of progressing.

This also means that for quests, almost all items must be untradeable, unsellable, and have no value. 

Stackable items can support multiple instances in a single inventory slot.

### Give Item
Gives an item to the player. 

    giveitem smithed-weapon-bronze-dagger

This will fail and end the script if the inventory is full.

### Take Item
Takes an item from the inventory. This assumes you have checked for the player having that item first!

    takeitem <item> <quantity> // quantity only if stackable
    takeitem coins 500 // Quantity is second argument if the item is stackable.
    takeitem smithed-weapon-bronze-dagger // Quantity is omitted and does not
                                          // work for unstackable items.

### Removing All items of <name>
This will remove all of an item and always continue on, regardless of how many of the item are removed.

take_all_items item-foo-bar item-foo-baz
has_any_item item-foo-bar item-foo-baz
  true -> label1
  false -> label2
end

### Branching [hasitem]
Checks to see if a player has an item and jumps to a label if they do. Quantity required for stackable items.

    hasitem smithed-weapon-bronze-dagger
      true -> <label>
      false -> <label>
    end
    
    hasitem coins 50
      true -> <label>
      false -> <label>
    end

This can also be used to check things like $tool-hammer for any tool that can be used as a hammer. 

### Inventory Size Check
Branches to ensure the player has enough slots to accept multiple items. 

    hasinvspace 3
      true -> <label>
      false -> <label>
    end

Technically the ‘true’ branch can be omitted, in which case it will move onto the next instruction.

## Skills
### Check Level
    checklevel forging 25
      true -> <label>
      false -> <label>
    end

### Check XP
    checkxp forging 5000
      true -> <label>
      false -> <label>
    end

### Give XP
    givexp forging 50

## Other
### Quest Complete

Used at or near the end of a script to open the Quest Complete screen for the named quest. Automatically sets that quest's `complete` variable to `true` without the need to use `setvar`.

    questcomplete
      quest <questname>
      reward <descriptive text>
      xp vitality 500
    end
    end

No matter the order in which `reward` and `xp` commands are given, `reward`'s descriptive text will always print first.

### MegaSwitch
This is syntactic sugar around multiple switch/checkitem/checklevel branches. Typically it's used to have many conditions on a given NPC, and checks conditions in the order they are listed, jumping to the first 'true' condition. Even if a later condition is true, it does not matter.

    megaswitch
      var foo/bar true -> <label> // equivalent to ‘switch’
      hasitem foo-bar-baz -> <label> // equivalent to hasitem, but quantity 
                                     // is not supported here
      checklevel forging 5 -> <label> // equivalent to checklevel
      default -> <label> // if everything else is false, goes here
    end

Though the above example is included to show what megaswitches can do, they will more often look like this:

    megaswitch
      var quest/complete true -> post_quest
      var quest/seeking_sword true -> sword_hint
      var quest/seeking_shield true -> shield_hint
      var quest/begun true -> instruct_again
      default -> intro
    end

Scripts performing more than a simple interaction (usually quest scripts) typically begin with a megaswitch. Though a megaswitch *can* contain checklevel, checkxp, and hasitem checks, the logic of a quest's progression is better managed using quest flags. As a rule of thumb, megaswitches should only be used to check variable conditions.
